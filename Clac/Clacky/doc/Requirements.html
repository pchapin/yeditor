    <h1>Clacky Requirements</h1>

    <h2>Functional Requirements</h2>

    <p>Clacky shall implement the program described in the <a href="User-Manual.html">Clacky
    User Manual</a>.</p>

    <h2>Non-Functional Requirements</h2>

    <h3>Platform</h3>

    <p>Clacky shall run on the Java Virtual machine and thus target all platforms supporting
    Java. Clacky assumes the existence of an interactive terminal where the user can enter
    Clacky command lines and view Clacky's textual output. Clacky shall not have a graphica user
    interface.</p>

    <h3>Performance</h3>

    <p>Clacky shall respond to user commands in a "reasonably" timely manner. The user is
    expected to understand that computation of difficult results may be time consuming.</p>

    <h3>Security</h3>

    <p>Clacky has no special security requirements</p>

    <h3>User Characteristics</h3>

    <p>Clacky users are assumed to be comfortable installing Java programs and interacting with
    text mode (console-style) applications. Clacky users are assumed to have the mathematical
    background necessary to understand the computed resuls (Clacky is not expected to provide
    any tutorial information).</p>

    <h3>Scale</h3>

    <p>Clacky is a single user system, but it shall make full utilization of the host processor
    and memory in its computation of user requested results.</p>

    <h3>Data Formats</h3>

    <p>Clacky is not currently required to read or write to non-volatile storage. No support for
    standardized file formats is required. No network communication is required.</p>

    <h3>Internationalization</h3>

    <p>Clacky shall be used in an English speaking environment. No support for international
    character sets or numeric formats is required.</p>
