    <h1>Clacky User Manual</h1>

    <p>This document is a complete user manual, reference guide, and tutorial for the Clacky
    calculator. If you are a user of Clacky you only need to read this document.</p>

    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p><i>TODO: Finish me!</i></p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>Clacky is a stack based calculator with an arbitrary number of stack levels. The "top"
    level is numbered 0 with levels below the top numbered 1, 2, etc. All operations apply to
    values in the stack, usually only in the top one or two levels.</p>

    <p>Clacky displays the stack with level 0 at the bottom of the display and the "lower"
    levels actually appearing above the upper levels. While this seems backward it actually
    makes sense when considering the effect of the non-commutative binary operators such as
    subtraction and division. The appearance of the stack just prior to executing those
    operations resembles how the numbers would traditionally be arranged on a sheet of paper.
    For example, when doing a division it is tradition for the dividend to be written above the
    divisor. With Clacky the dividend is pushed first and thus appears above the divisor on the
    display.</p>

    <p>The Clacky stack can store four different data types.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p><strong>Integer</strong>. Clacky integers have arbitrary precision and can contain as
      many digits as required (until memory is exhausted). They are thus an accurate
      representation of the mathematical integer type.</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>Rational</strong>. Rational numbers are fractions with a numerator and a
      denominator. Clacky rationals have arbitrary precision integers for both values. Clacky
      always stores and displays rational numbers in reduced form.</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>Float</strong>. Clacky floating point values using the underlying type
      <tt>double</tt> as provided by the Java virtual machine.</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>Complex</strong>. Clacky stores complex numbers as real and imaginary parts
      using the underlying JVM type double for each component.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>If an arithmetic operation is done on two values of the same type the result is of that
    type. If an aritmetic operation is done on two values of different types, the type with the
    lower number in the list above is promoted to the type with the higher number. The result is
    of the higher numbered type.</p>

    <p>For example, if an Integer is added to a Float, the Integer is prompted to Float and the
    result is Float. Similarly if a Rational is multiplied by a Complex, the Rational is
    prompted to Complex and the result is Complex.</p>

    <p>Unary operations return the type most appropriate for the operand and the operation. For
    example the <tt>sin</tt> of an Integer is a Float and the <tt>sqrt</tt> of a Rational is a
    Float unless the Rational is negative (in which case its <tt>sqrt</tt> is a Complex).</p>

    <p>The Clacky command line consists of a sequence of whitespace separated "words." Each word
    is either a value to be pushed on the stack or the name of an operation or function. Value
    words have the following format.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p><strong>Integer</strong>. Integers consist of a sequence of digit characters with
      an optional leading <tt>+</tt> or <tt>-</tt> (no space is allowed between the leading sign
      and the digits of the number). The sequence of digits can have arbitrary length. Clacky
      integers have infinite precision.</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>Float</strong>. Floats are numbers containing either a decimal point or an
      exponent. They have a format similar to floating point literals in many programming
      languages.</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>Rational</strong>. Rationals appear to be two integers separated by a
      <tt>/</tt>. No space is allowed on either side of the slash. If a leading sign is present
      it only appears on the numerator.</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>Complex</strong>. Complex values consist of two Float values inside
      parentheses and separated by a comma. For example: <tt>(3.14, -2.72)</tt>. Notice that
      white space is allowed between the components of the complex number. That space does not
      create two words, the entire number is considerd a single word.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p><i>TODO: Provide a list of supported Clacky operations and functions.</i></p>

    <p>Clacky processes the entire command line before displaying the resulting stack. This
    allows multiple operations to be performed in "one step." Once Clacky has processed the
    command line it accepts another command line for processing.</p>

    <p>Certain special words beginning with <tt>.</tt> (dot) are treated by Clacky as commands.
    They are not operations or functions. The following is a list of Clacky commands.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>.debug</strong>: Activate Clacky debugging features (useful for
      developers)</li>
      <li><strong>.deg</strong>: Switch to degrees mode</li>
      <li><strong>.nodebug</strong>: Deactivate Clacky debugging features</li>
      <li><strong>.quit</strong>: Terminate Clacky</li>
      <li><strong>.rad</strong>: Switch to radians mode</li>
    </ul>
