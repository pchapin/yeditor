    <h1>Clacky Documentation</h1>

    <p>Clacky is a desktop calculator program written in Java. Its primary purpose is to serve
    as an educational vehicle in Vermont Technical College's CIS-2271 (Java Programming) class.
    Secondarily it is also intended to be a useful calculator program.</p>

    <p>Because Clacky targets desktop and laptop class machines (and not, for example, phones or
    tablets) it can take advantage of the I/O facilities of the intended platforms to improve
    the user experience. For example, Clacky can support long input commands, output significant
    amounts of information, and use (potentially large) files for storage. The design of Clacky
    reflects this.</p>

    <p>Clacky is loosely based on the <a href="https://github.com/pchapin/clac">Clac</a>
    calculator project. Even the name "Clacky" is intended to be evocative of Clac. However,
    Clacky is a much simpler program with fewer features and more restricted goals. However, it
    is possible that the Clacky project will be merged into Clac at some point in the
    future.</p>

    <p>This is the documentation set for Clacky.</p>
