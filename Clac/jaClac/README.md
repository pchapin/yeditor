jaClac
======

This folder contains a Java implementation of Clac. There are three components. The jClac
subfolder contains a standalone Java application for the desktop. The aClac subfolder contains
an Android version of Clac. The Common subfolder contains code that is shared between jClac and
aClac.

Roughly speaking the Common subfolder contains the Clac engine and supporting Clac entities, and
the jClac and aClac folders contain user interface code for their respective platforms.
Additional versions of Clac, for example an applet for a web browser, would hopefully be able to
use the same Common folder but have its own UI folder.

The versions of Clac here use IntelliJ IDE as their build environment.
