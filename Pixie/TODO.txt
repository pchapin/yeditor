These items are in no particular order, but they probably should be arranged in order of
priority and/or level of difficulty.

+ Define an XML format for the tasks file and implement support for it.

+ Update the documentation to describe Pixie's "time tracker" features.

+ Add support for a configuration file?

+ Make the existing features more robust against bad input. An error message display function
should be added. Right now the program mostly just ignores errors without telling the user
about them.

+ Consider moving to a Model-View-Controller design. For example, the Task_Window should not
really own the vector of tasks. Instead it should only be responsible for displaying them.

+ Improve the user interface to take better advantage of scr.

+ Add new features.
  - It might be nice to have an option to exit the program without saving the task list.
  - A help command that lists the available commands and their syntax.
  - An indication that the task list has changed (so the user knows when to "save").
  
+ The task window could use some kind of label ("Task List"), perhaps in the border at the top.
