<h1>Pixie Homework #1 (CIS-2260, Fall 2007)</h1>

<p>In this assignment you will implement a basic form of Pixie's main task
window. This window displays a list of user tasks, sorted in descending order
of urgency. Each line in the window contains information about one tasks. The
lines do not wrap; if they are longer than the window is wide, they are
simply truncated. Each line contains four fields as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Brief description of the task.</li>
  <li>Due date for the task in the format YYYY-MM-DD.</li>
  <li>Priority of the task as an integer between 0 and 99.</li>
  <li>"Urgency factor" of the task, as described below, in the range from
    0.00 to 9.99.</li>
</ol>

<p>The fields are to have a fixed position on each line (so they line up
nicely when displayed in the window). For this assignment you are to
implement the Get_Image method in class Task_Window to format the task
information properly.</p>
