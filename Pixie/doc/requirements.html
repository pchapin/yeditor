<h1>Pixie</h1>
<hr />

<p>This document describes <em>Pixie</em>, a personal time management
application. Pixie is an ordinary application that runs on Windows and Linux
systems. At this time it does not target any PDA device (except to the extent
such devices can run normal Windows or Linux applications). However, Pixie
has a number of features that make it unusually light weight; adapting Pixie
to various small devices should hopefully not be too difficult.</p>

<p>Pixie's main features are</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Individual</strong>. Pixie does not currently contain
    support for group or team features. Pixie is self contained and
    <em>private</em>. No information is ever exported from Pixie without the
    user taking explicit steps to do so.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>Integrated</strong>. Pixie includes an appointment calendar,
    prioritized task and todo lists, and time tracking (auditing) features.
    Pixie is intended to be the central location for all of her user's time
    management needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>Active</strong>. Pixie uses algorithms borrowed from the
    theory of operating systems to schedule tasks and alert her user about
    impending deadlines and events.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>Small</strong>. Pixie consumes minimal system resources and
    is non-intrusive. Pixie can be easily run from a flash drive or a network
    drive. Pixie can be used over a text mode terminal.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>Scriptable</strong>. Pixie provides a comprehensive command
    line interface that allows all of her functions to be used
    non-interactively. This allows Pixie to be used in shell scripts and
    batch files, or launched periodically via a scheduling service.
    Eventually Pixie will be directly runnable as a service and able to
    automatically contact her user by, for example, sending email or instant
    messages.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This document describes Pixie's features at a high level. It can be used
to define the software requirements for the Pixie developers. It can also
give potential users a clear idea of what Pixie does and does not do.</p>

<h2>Data Model</h2>

<p>Pixie manages several kinds of entities.</p>
<dl>
  <dt><strong>Events</strong></dt>
    <dd><p>An event is something that occurs usually just once at a specific
      time, although some events are periodic and automatically reschedule
      themselves after they occur. Some events have no duration, in effect
      lasting for zero seconds and just serving to mark a particular moment
      of interest. These events might occur at a specific hour, minute, or
      even second, but some of these events might only be specified to the
      nearest day, week, or month. However, most events do have a duration,
      typically short (a few minutes to a few hours at the most).</p>
      <p>Pixie assumes that her user does not need to do anything specfic to
      prepare for an event. The existence of an event in Pixie's calendar
      database is only for the user's information. Pixie informs her user
      when events are approaching but never sounds an alarm condition because
      of an event. There is no concept of an "overdue" event. Once an event
      has passed it is removed from the active calendar (unless it
      reschedules itself, in which case a new event is created to replace the
      old one).</p>
      <p>Examples of events are: "Computer Club Meeting", "Full Moon", and
      "Vacation."</p>
    </dd>
  <dt><strong>Tasks</strong></dt>
    <dd><p>A task is a job that Pixie's user must complete. Unlike events
      tasks have specific deadlines and can become overdue. Also, unlike
      events tasks have a priority. The priority values assigned to tasks are
      meaningful to Pixie's user. Pixie only considers relative priorities
      when making scheduling suggestions. Also unlike events, tasks can have
      fairly long durations. A task might be active for days or weeks (or
      even months). Tasks have an optional start time so that a task can be
      added to Pixie's calendar database before it is active (Pixie will
      never suggest working on the task until it becomes active). Unlike
      events, tasks are not removed from the active calendar until they are
      specifically marked as completed. However, like events, tasks can
      automatically reschedule themselves. Pixie does not currently support
      any notion of subtasks. If a large task needs to be broken into several
      component tasks, it is up to Pixie's user to explicitly manage that.</p>
      <p>Examples of tasks are: "Finish Homework #3", "Prepare Agenda for
      Computer Club Meeting", and "Submit Financial Aid Paperwork."</p>
    </dd>
  <dt><strong>Todo Items</strong></dt>
    <dd><p>A todo item is a general activity that Pixie's user wants to
      accomplish at some point. Unlike tasks, todo items do not have specific
      deadlines or start dates (they become active as soon as they are
      entered). Todo items do have priorities, however, and must be
      explicitly marked as completed. Also todo items have a record of past
      activity: the amount of time spent working on the todo item so far.
      Pixie dynamically increases the priority of a todo item if it remains
      in the sytem a long time without any activity. The more time spent on a
      todo item, the lower its priority becomes. Priority values of tasks and
      todo items are assumed to be comparable and Pixie makes scheduling
      suggestions based on the assumption that the priorities of both types
      of entities have the same meaning.</p>
      <p>Examples of todo items are: "Wash the Car", "Read My New C++ Book",
      and "Learn to Play the Flute."</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>Pixie assigns a unique ID number to every entity that she knows about. ID
numbers are never reused in the scope of a single Pixie calendar database.
All the fields of an entity, including its title and description, can be
edited without changing the entity's identity. Entities are stored on disk
(the calendar database) between Pixie sessions. At any time there is a set of
active entities, called the active calendar, consisting of events that have
not yet occurred and tasks and todo items that are not completed. Pixie
normally only displays the active calendar to the user, but inactive entities
are stored in the calendar database (unless explicitly deleted or purged by
the user) and can be reviewed if desired. Tasks and todo items can be
converted back and forth without changing their ID numbers by simply adding
or removing a deadline time.</p>

<p>Unlike most calendar programs, Pixie does not (by default) present the
active entities to the user in chronological order. Although Pixie does have
a "calendar view" that can be used for viewing events and task deadlines
(todo items do not appear in the calendar view), Pixie's main display is the
"suggested activity view" (SAV). Pixie uses a scheduling algorithm to combine
priority, deadline, and past activity information and organizes the SAV to
show the most urgent entity first. To work most efficiently you should next
do whatever activity Pixie shows at the top of the SAV list.</p>

<p>Different scheduling algorithms optimize different characteristics. For
example, you may wish to minimize the number of deadlines you miss, or
maximize your task throughput (maximum number of tasks completed per unit of
time), or minimize your response time to new task requests. These
characteristics are not always compatible. Pixie allows you to switch
scheduling algorithms on the fly. She recomputes the SAV according to the
currently selected algorithm to let you immediately see the impact of
different scheduling policies. For example, the entity at the top of the SAV
might change when you switch from minimizing missed deadlines to minimizing
response time.</p>
