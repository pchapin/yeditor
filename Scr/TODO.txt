LAST REVISED : 2009-03-29
=========================

+ Reorganize the design so that it is coherent and object oriented. Don't fret about
compatibility.

+ Reimplement scr::key( ) for Win32 so that it uses the console API directly.

+ Elaborate on the documentation (doxygen format).

+ Elaborate on the test program to exercise the various high level modules (see the contents of
the various ZIP archives).

+ Add new functionality.

+ Apply PC-Lint to all the modules, clean up any issues that are reported.

+ Create platform makefiles for the two test programs (check_simple and check_manager),
following the lead set in the main project.
