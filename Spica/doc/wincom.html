<H2>Introduction</H2>

This component is intended to simplify using serial ports on a Win32
machine. It is currently rather rough and suffers from a number of
important limitations. It is my hope that eventually some of these
limitations will be removed. If you find this component close to what
you need, but not exactly what you need, I invite you to improve it! Be
sure to let me know if you do so that I can incorporate your changes
into my official version.<P>

WinCom requires multiple threads. For this reason you must #define the
symbol pMULTITHREADED before you compile WinCom. You should also #define
this symbol for any of my other components that you might be using in
your program. Note that in some cases, WinCom can autodetect the fact
that you are building a multithreaded program. See the file environ.h
and the <A HREF="overview.htm">overview document</A> for more
information.<P>

For each port object created, WinCom creates a helper thread that reads
the port. That thread calls a client-defined function for every
character that it receives. In this way, you can process input from the
port asynchronously to your program's other activities. In particular,
you can process unsolicited input whenever it appears.<P>

WinCom is known to work properly under Windows 95. However, I have heard
that it is necessary to use a Win32 feature called "overlapped I/O" to
get WinCom's asynchronous reads to work properly under Windows NT. I am
not currently using that feature in WinCom so it is possible that it
will fail on a Windows NT machine. This is one area that needs more
work.<P>

<HR>
<H2>The Read Processor Function</H2>

Before you can use a port, you need to prepare a function that will
process the characters read by that port. This function should have the
signature<P>

<TT>void Read_Processor(char);</TT><P>

You may name the function whatever you like. The name
<TT>Read_Processor</TT> above is just for illustration. Each character
read from the port will be passed to this function for processing. When
this function returns, the next character will be read from the port.
This function need not return "quickly." WinCom will buffer the data as
necessary.<P>

<I>However, there may be a problem with the way WinCom is handling that
buffering. It may be that only 256 characters will be buffered. Although
additional characters shouldn't be lost, WinCom might not give them to
your function until long after they have arrived. This problem will
exist if WaitCommEvent() does not notice characters that have
accumulated in the serial port's buffer before it is called. I'm not
sure of how that Win32 function behaves in this case. This is another
area where more work is necessary.</I><P>

Your function will be called with the value '\000' (the null character)
when WinCom has no more data available "immediately." This does
<EM>not</EM> mean the end of input has been reached. It only means that
no characters have arrived at the input port during the last 50 mS. Your
function can use this information to detect the end of the current
transaction (line, record, etc) and respond accordingly.<P>

If your function throws an exception, it will be caught by WinCom and an
exception notification message box will be displayed. In addition, the
exception will be logged to WinDebug. The bad_alloc exception, and the
pcc::Win32::API_Error exception are treated separately. All other
exceptions are handled generically.<P>

<CENTER>
<B>Warning!</B>
</CENTER><P>

Be advised that your function will be called in the context of the
port's helper thread. Processing of input characters occurs
asynchronously to all other threads in the program. If you want your
input to be sychronized to the activities of some other thread, then it
is up to you to handle that.<P>

<HR>
<H2>class Com_Port</H2>

To use WinCom, you must create an object of type Com_Port for each
serial port you want to use. Here I will describe the member functions
for this class.<P>

<DL>

<DT><B><TT>Com_Port(bool Testing = false);</TT></B><P>

<DD>The constructor initailizes a few internal data objects in the
Com_Port object. It does <EM>not</EM> initalize the port itself. You can
construct a Com_Port object without knowing yet what parameters you want
to use for the port. If the flag <TT>Testing</TT> is "true", the
Com_Port object is created in testing mode. In that mode all writes to
the port are ignored and reads are taken from a source of simulated
input. This allows you to test the behavior of your program without a
working device connected to the real serial port. You can submit
simulated input to the Com_Port object before you start using it to
simulate the responses sent to you by a real (but not present)
device.<P>

<DT><B><TT>~Com_Port();</TT></B><P>

<DD>The destructor stops the helper thread and resets the port to the
state that it had before it was set. If the helper thread is not running
or the port not set, this function correctly does nothing.<P>

<DT><B><TT>void Set(const char *Name, int Baud, void (*Read)(char));</TT></B><P>

<DD>This function sets the port's parameters. The given name is the name
of the pseudo file representing the port. In most cases it will be
something like "COM1" or "COM2." However, more elaborate file names are
possible in the usual manner supported by your Win32 machine. The baud
rate given is a value such as 9600. The parameter <TT>Read</TT> is a
pointer to your read processing function that will be called by the
helper thread as I described above.<P>

This function will set the port to 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, activiate
RTS/CTS flow control, and set both read and write timeouts to
"reasonable" values. It would probably be nice if you were allowed to
control some of these settings. However, in the interest of simplicity
(for you) I decided that the settings above would be appropriate in most
cases. A future version of WinCom may allow you more control over the
port's configuration.<P>

This function will remember the port's original state so that it can be
reset to that state later. It also logs several messages to WinDebug to
inform you of the port's status.<P>

<DT><B><TT>void Set_Input(const string &Input);</TT></B><P>

<DD>This function allows you to configure simulated input that will be
later returned by the reading operation. It is useful only if you
construct the port in testing mode.<P>

After each line of simulated input, the Com_Port's helper thread will
send a '\000' to your read processor function. This will cause your
function to conclude that line is a complete transaction (see above). If
there is no simulated input left, the Com_Port's helper thread will
block. At a later time, you can submit more simulated input to unblock
that thread. For example:<P>

<PRE>
My_Port.Write("Hello, World!\r");
#if defined(TESTING_MODE)
My_Port.Set_Input("This is a simulated response.\r");
#endif
</PRE><P>

In this way you can exercise your read function without having a real
device attached to the serial port.<P>

<DT><B><TT>void Start_Reading();</TT></B><P>

<DD>This function starts the port's helper thread. If you do not call
this function, no data will ever be read from the port. It is not an
error to call this function more than once. If the helper thread is
already started, the call will be ignored. This function logs a message
to WinDebug.<P>

<DT><B><TT>void Write(const char *);</TT></B><P>

<DD>This function writes a null terminated string to the port. The null
byte is not written. Because there is no facility for writing arbitrary
blocks of data to the port, WinCom is really only suitable for plain
text transactions with remote devices. A future version of WinCom might
lift this restriction.<P>

If the write operation fails, WinCom will throw a pcc::Win32::API_Error
exception. The most likely reason for this to happen is because the
write operation timed out waiting for an appropriate hardware handshake.
Be sure the remote device supports RTS/CTS flow control and is
configured to use it.<P>

<DT><B><TT>void Stop_Reading();</TT></B><P>

<DD>This function kills the port's helper thread, but does not otherwise
reconfigure the port. You can use it to temporarily stop the helper
thread from delivering characters to you. You can restart the thread
later by calling <TT>Start_Reading()</TT> at any time. If the helper
thread is already stopped when you call <TT>Stop_Reading()</TT>, there
is no effect.<P>

This function will immediately and abruptly kill the helper thread. If
the helper thread is actually in your read processor function at the
time it may leave resources unreleased (depending on how your function
is written). It is best to be sure that the reader thread is blocked
waiting for input -- that no more input will be forthcoming -- before
you try to stop it. A future version of WinCom may improve the handling
of this function so that a clean stop is possible at any time.<P>

<DT><B><TT>void Unset();</TT></B><P>

<DD>This function unsets the port and restores it to the same state that
it had before <TT>Set()</TT> was called. After calling this function you
can call <TT>Set()</TT> again to give the Com_Port object new
parameters. You should avoid calling <TT>Set()</TT> twice in a row.<P>

This function will stop the helper thread if it is running. The same
warnings apply here as to the function <TT>Stop_Reading()</TT> above.<P>
