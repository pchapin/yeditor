<H2>Introduction</H2>

Source level debuggers are wonderful tools. I use them myself. However,
sometimes it is necessary to debug an application when such a tool can't
be used. One such time is when an application malfunctions in the field
but works perfectly on the developer's station. How can the developer
get at information about a program's internal state when the program is
running on a machine without software development tools on hand? What if
the program only malfunctions when certain, specialized hardware is
connected to the machine that the developer can't access during
development?<P>

To handle cases like this, WinDebug allows the developer to embed a
small, simple debugging tool into the shipping application. If the
application malfunctions in the field, the developer can work with the
end user, for example over the phone, to get insight about the program's
operation. The developer can arrange for WinDebug to activate when
certain, perhaps undocumented, options are selected. Then the end user
can relay WinDebug's output to the developer and the developer can
instruct the end user in how to manipulate WinDebug.<P>

Although such a debugging environment is crude, if the developer plans
carefully it can be effective enough to give the information that is
required. This is the purpose of WinDebug. It is not intended to replace
traditional debuggers. It is intended to supplement them.<P>

<HR>
<H2>Installing WinDebug</H2>

WinDebug must be compiled into your application like any other module.
You need to include the file <TT>windebug.rc</TT> in your application's
resource script and you need to include the file <TT>windebug.cpp</TT>
in your application's project. You also need to have the files
<TT>windebug.rh</TT> and <TT>windebug.ico</TT> on hand. They are brought
into the application during the build process.<P>

To use WinDebug interactively, your application must call
<TT>create_debugWindow()</TT>. This function causes the debugging
window, a child of the desktop, to appear on the display. The debugging
window shows the log of debug messages. The end user can interact with
WinDebug by selecting menu items in the debugging window.<P>

The debugging system is active internally even when the debugging window
is not being displayed. The window only gives the end user a way to
inspect the debug messages and adjust WinDebug's settings. When the
window is closed, debugging information will continue to be
collected.<P>

<HR>
<H2>Instrumenting Your Program</H2>

To gain any useful information from WinDebug, you need to include
debugging calls throughout your application. These calls are very
similar in concept to the age-old method of sprinkling debugging
<TT>printf()</TT> statements in a program. Except, unlike
<TT>printf()</TT> statements, the output of WinDebug's debugging calls
is collected in the log displayed in the debugging window. Such material
does not interfere with the normal output of the program and can thus
remain in the shipping version of the application.<P>

There are only a few ways to instrument your program using the current
version of WinDebug.<P>

<DL>

<DT><B><TT>void Tracer(int level, char *message);</TT></B><P>

<DD>Although I show <TT>Tracer</TT> as a function above, it is actually
implemented as a function-like macro. It creates an object of type
Tracer and passes its parameters to that object. In addition, it also
uses the <TT>__FILE__</TT> and <TT>__LINE__</TT> macros to pass the file
name and line number to the underlying Tracer object.<P>

The constructor of the Tracer object logs the provided information to
the debugging window. The message can be any string that is meaningful
to you. The level is intended to represent the "detail level" of this
trace point. A level of one is shallow. A level of, for example, 5 would
be very detailed. You can assign whatever meaning you like to the
different detail levels. For example<P>

<PRE>
void some_function(int X, int Y)
{
  Tracer(2, "Entered some_function()");

  // etc...
}
</PRE><P>

This would log a message to the debug window that looks like<P>

<PRE>
TP: (2) Entered some_function() FILE=xyz.cpp LINE=245
</PRE><P>

The "TP" at the start of the line indicates that the message comes from
a trace point. The FILE and LINE values at the end of the message
represent the location in the source code where the Tracer object was
created.<P>

<DT><B><TT>class debugstream</TT></B><P>

<DD>Class debugstream is derived from class ostringstring and supports
all of ostringstream's behavior. In particular you can print the values
of variables into it. However, this class also supports a <TT>say()</TT>
function that causes the formatted message to be logged to the debug
window. For example<P>

<PRE>
debugstream Message;

Message &lt;&lt; "count = " &lt;&lt; count;
Message.say(1);
</PRE><P>

This would log a message to the debug window that looks like

<PRE>
  : (1) count = 12
</PRE><P>

Here I'm assuming the value of the variable <TT>count</TT> was 12. This
class gives you the functionality of debugging <TT>printf()</TT> in a
traditional application. Note that <TT>say()</TT>'s parameter is the
detail level of the message.<P>

<DT><B><TT>class notifystream</TT></B><P>

<DD>Class notifystream is basically the same as class debugstream. It is
also derived from ostringstring and supports all of ostringstream's
behavior. It also has a <TT>say()</TT> function (that takes no
parameters) that causes the message formated into it to be logged to the
debug window.<P>

However, a notifystream is intended to process messages in exception
handlers. It logs all messages to the debug window with an "EX" prefix
and a detail level of zero. In addition, it displays a message box with
the caption "Exception Notification" and containing the formatted
message. In short, notifystreams give you an easy to way to display an
exception notification to the user and log it to the debug window in a
single step.<P>

</DL>

<HR>
<H2>Using the Debug Window</H2>

Only 250 messages are shown in the debug window. If more messages
arrive, old ones are discarded. In the current version of WinDebug, the
number of messages buffered is not configurable. Each message is
prefixed with a line number. This makes it easier to refer to a specific
message and to notice new (perhaps identical) messages as they appear.
The line numbers always advance and might go well beyond 250 during the
life of the program.<P>

Several debugging operations are supported on the debug window's menus.
Some of the menu items are currently not implemented, but will be in a
future version of the WinDebug.<P>

<DL>

<DT><B><TT>File|Configure</TT></B> (Not implemented)<P>

<DD>This menu item brings up a dialog box that allows the user to set
the desired detail level. Debug messages that are deeper than the
current detail level are ignored. This allows you to get a general
overview of the program's operation without getting lost in the details.<P>

In addition, the configuration dialog allows you to set a "start point"
and "stop point" that defines when debug messages will be collected.
This allows you to focus your attention on the section of the program
that seems to be malfunctioning.<P>

<DT><B><TT>File|Save Buffer</TT></B><P>

<DD>This option saves the current collection of debug messages to the
file you specify. You can use this option to make a "snapshot" of the
debug log. End users can send developers such snapshots for detailed
analysis.<P>

<DT><B><TT>File|Start Saving Log</TT></B><P>

<DD>This option allows the user to open a file on disk where debugging
messages will be logged from then on. Unlike the "Save Buffer" option,
current messages are not put into the disk log. However, all future
messages are added to the disk log. Be careful when you use this option.
There is no limit to the number of messages that can be saved to
disk.<P>

<DT><B><TT>File|Stop Saving Log</TT></B><P>

<DD>This option turns off the disk log file feature and closes the file.<P>

<DT><B><TT>File|Exit Application</TT></B> (Not implemented)<P>

<DD>This option <B>exits the entire application</B>! It is useful if the
program is in a confused state and stopped on a WinDebug break point
(break points are not yet implemented). Keep in mind that it is normally
better to close the application using whatever method it defines for
that purpose. To close the debug window, use the close box in the upper
right corner of the window.<P>

</DL>

<HR>
<H2>Multithread Support</H2>

WinDebug is designed to function correctly in a multithreaded program.
If you are building a multithreaded program, be sure to #define the
symbol pMULTITHREADED when compiling WinDebug. See the <A
HREF="overview.htm">overview document</A> for more information.<P>

Multiple threads can add debug messages to the log with no danger of
data corruption. Access to the log is synchronized between all threads
that need it -- including the thread that paints the debug window
itself.<P>
