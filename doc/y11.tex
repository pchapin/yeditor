\chapter{To Y v1.1 Users}

Y version 2.0 is radically different than Y version 1.1 because of its macro language. Some
features of version 1.1 have actually been deleted from the editor. Instead they can be
implemented as macros. In the long run this is a more flexible approach than implementing every
possible feature in the editor itself. The file \filename{y11.ymy} (distributed with Y) is a
start-up macro that causes Y to emulate version 1.1. If you arrange for Y to use
\filename{y11.ymy}, all that you know about version 1.1 should apply. You can then modify
\filename{y11.ymy} as you wish for additional effects.

Here are some features of Y version 1.1 that are no longer part of the editor, but that are
implemented as macros in \filename{y11.ymy}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The handling of \filename{filelist.yfy}.
\item The paragraph reformatting feature.
\item The /L and /C command line options.
\item The special handling of `\{' and `\}' in C language files.
\item Auto-indentation.
\end{enumerate}

You can add some of the demonstration macros distributed with Y to \filename{y11.ymy} to extend
the abilities of the editor without throwing out version 1.1 compatibility.

Y has dropped the mouse support that existed in version 1.1. This was done because version 1.1's
mouse support was not very useful and caused some problems.
