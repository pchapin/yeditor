The scr Screen Handling Library
===============================

This folder contains the scr library. See the scr documentation for more information about the
nature and scope of this project. Here are a few issues to keep in mind.

1. It is intended for scr to be compiled with Visual C++ on Windows, with Open Watcom on (16
   bit) DOS, Windows, and OS/2, and with Code::Blocks (with gcc) on Linux.

2. This folder contains a VC++ solution file, Open Watcom build control files for WMAKE, and a
   Code::Blocks project file.

3. The scr library is documented using doxygen.

When adding or removing modules from this library you should:

+ Edit the Visual Studio project file to reflect the change.
+ Edit master.mif to reflect the change.
+ Edit scr.cds to reflect the change.
+ Edit the Code::Blocks project file to reflect the change.
