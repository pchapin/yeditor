//! List of pointers to EditBuffer objects.
/*!
 *  This class is a wrapper around List that implements a list of pointers to EditBuffer
 *  objects. The EditBuffers pointed at by the elements of this list must be dynamically
 *  allocated. They should not be shared between two instances of EditList, except perhaps
 *  temporarily. The destructor of EditList deletes all the pointers on the list as a service.
 *
 *  Note that the underlying List template allows one to put NULL pointers on the list. However,
 *  EditList do not allow this, trading in generality for an easier interface. In effect,
 *  EditList removes a level of indirection allowing its clients to deal with pointers to
 *  EditBuffers rather than pointers to pointers to EditBuffers.
