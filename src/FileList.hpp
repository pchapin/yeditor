class YEditFile;

//! Encloses functions that manipulate the file list abstract object.
/*!
 * The file list is Y's list of currently open files. This namespace contains functions for
 * manipulating and controlling that list. Note that the file list is polymorphic. Different
 * file types provide specialized editing experiences as appropriate. Y stores these different
 * types in a common file list and uses virtual functions to handle the specialized editing
 * operations.
 *
 * The FileList maintains a notion of "currently active file." This is the file with which the
 * user is interacting. Clients of FileList get a handle to the currently active file using
 * FileList::active_file( ). Several of the functions in FileList change the active file and
 * thus invalidate any previously obtained handles. Clients need to be aware of this.

 * Operations defined for the FileList are the sort that require knowledge about more than one
 * file. Operations that only affect one file are defined in YEditFile's interface. A future
 * version of FileList may support multiple file lists (if needed) and may support a somewhat
 * cleaner way of keeping track of active file handles. In addition, some of the functionality
 * in YEditFile might get moved here eventually. In particular, YEditFile::display( ) knows
 * nothing about the other files. In a multi-windowed version of Y that maintained images of
 * several different files on the screen at once, display( ) might have to be in FileList.
