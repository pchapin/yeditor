    \brief   Interface to class FilePosition
    \author  Peter C. Chapin <PChapin@vtc.vsc.edu>

This file contains the interface to class FilePosition. Objects of this class record and
manipulate the description of where in the file "we are." They are interested not only in the
location of the cursor (current point), but also the location of the window (ie which portion of
the file is currently to be displayed. Objects of this class insure that the cursor never strays
outside the window.

Notice that the first line in the file is line zero. Further notice that the first column in the
file is column zero. Line numbers are of type long (negative numbers treated like zero), and
column numbers are of type unsigned.

This implementation is simple in that the dimensions of the window are hard coded to satisfy Ys
needs. Obviously one can do better than that. In a future version, FilePosition objects may be
able to deal with various sized windows. Certainly, this situation will need correcting before Y
could become multiwindowed (should that ever become desirable).
