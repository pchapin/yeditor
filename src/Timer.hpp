     * Objects from class Timer are useful for timing relatively long events in programs. They
     * use the system clock as a base for generating time delays and thus are not suitable (in
     * most cases) for short delays.
     *
     * Timers do not load the system in any way while they are timing. Only when they are
     * started and stopped do they check the system clock. They can thus be fooled if the system
     * clock is changed during the timing interval.
     *
     * Timers allow for multiple starts and stops. In addition, their internal state can be
     * obtained by client code.
