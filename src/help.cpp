/*! \file    help.cpp
 *  \brief   Text of the help screens.
 *  \author  Peter C. Chapin <chapinp@acm.org>
 *
 * The help text is out of date; it needs a major overhaul.
 *
 * This file contains only the declaration of several large arrays of char pointers. The text
 * defined by these arrays form all of the help screens used by Y. The format is not the easiest
 * to process, but it is easy to produce and change.
