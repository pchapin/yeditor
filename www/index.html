    <h1>Y Text Editor</h1>

    <hr/>
    <h2>Overview and History</h2>

    <p>Y is a simple, but efficient programmer's text editor. It was originally written in the
    early 1990s as an MS-DOS application to support the programming classes in the Electrical
    and Computer Engineering Technology Department at <a href="http://www.vtc.edu/">Vermont
    Technical College</a>. Its main goals were ease of use and lightweight design. The original
    version of Y that was widely used, version 1.1, executed efficiently even on 4.77 MHz 8088
    machines.</p>

    <p>Y did not attempt to be all things to all people. It was a custom application and thus
    adapted precisely for the usage it received. However, due to its popularity in the VTC
    community, there were many requests for enhancements. In the mid-1990s I began work on Y
    version 2.0. The new version of Y was intended to provide significantly more functionality
    by way of a new macro language. The idea was to make the macro language powerful enough so
    that users could provide support for enhanced features themselves by creating suitable
    macros. However, it was also my intention to stay true to Y's original design goals and keep
    the program essentially simple and lightweight.</p>

    <p>Due to many distractions in my life, work on Y 2.0 is still incomplete. The macro
    language is only partially implemented and still not powerful enough to be really useful.
    There has been much refactoring of Y's internals to accommidate the macro engine, but the
    overall interface and experience of using Y has changed very little since version 1.1.</p>

    <p>Y has seen many changes in the computer industry over its long life. The current code
    base for Y targets not only MS-DOS (largely untested these days), but also Windows, OS/2
    (also largely untested), and most recently Linux and Cygwin. Although Y was initially
    developed using Turbo C++ version 1.0, it is currently compiled with recent versions of
    Visual C++ and g++. While not part of Y's original design goals, it has become a cross
    platform, multi-compiler editor.</p>

    <p>Over much of Y's lifespan the main development compiler has been Open Watcom C++.
    Unfortunately Y currently makes use of certain features of modern C++ that are not supported
    by Open Watcom. However, it is my hope that some future version of Open Watcom will be able
    to compile Y again. Note that it was Open Watcom that generated the MS-DOS and OS/2 versions
    of Y and so support for those platforms is in "hibernation" until Open Watcom matures.</p>

    <p>At the moment Y's source code is being cleaned up and modernized. Compliation only
    definitely works with Visual Studio 2013 or g++ version 4.8 or higher. Development occurs on
    Windows and Linux with the occasional test on Cygwin (using g++). Once the code
    modernization settles down, I will hopefully resume forward development of Y to complete the
    macro language as long planned. In the meantime to compile Y the easiest way is load the
    <tt>Y.sln</tt> file into Visual Studio and do a "Build Solution" operation. See the
    README.txt file in the code base for more details about the other build and IDE options.</p>

    <h2>Downloads</h2>

    <p>The source code for Y is available via Git from GitHub at the URL
    <tt>https://github.com/pchapin/yeditor</tt>. Y requires two additional supporting projects,
    Scr and Spica, both also available on my GitHub site. The build control files require that
    these supporting projects be installed in a folder that is a sibling of the folder where the
    Y project is cloned. See the README.txt file in the code base for more information.</p>

    <p>Eventually it is my hope to post installers and documentation here for the various
    versions of Y available.</p>

    <p>Y's internals are documented with <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/">Doxygen</a>. You
    should be able to use the Doxygen tool to generate nicely formatted Doxyen documentation for
    internal classes, functions, etc.</p>
